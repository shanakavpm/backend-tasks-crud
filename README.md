## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

You may also try the [Laravel Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.laravel.com), where you will be guided through building a modern Laravel application from scratch.

If you don't feel like reading, [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com) can help. Laracasts contains thousands of video tutorials on a range of topics including Laravel, modern PHP, unit testing, and JavaScript. Boost your skills by digging into our comprehensive video library.

Laravel Project Setup
1. Clone the Project

Clone the repository using the following command:

git clone <repository_url>

2. Navigate to the Project Directory

Change into the project directory:

cd project-directory

3. Install Dependencies

Ensure that Composer is installed, then install the project dependencies by running:

composer install

4. Set Up Environment File

Copy the example environment file:

cp .env.example .env

Set your environment variables (e.g., database configuration, API URL) in the .env file.
5. Generate Application Key

Generate the application key by running:

php artisan key:generate

6. Run Database Migrations and Seeders

Run the database migrations to create the necessary tables:

php artisan migrate

(Optional) To populate the database with sample data, run:

php artisan db:seed

7. Set Up PHPUnit Configuration

Ensure the phpunit.xml configuration file is set up correctly. If missing, copy the default:

Update PHPUnit Configuration

Check the .env file for database connections and ensure they are configured for testing (e.g., using a separate test database).
8. Run PHPUnit Tests

To run PHPUnit tests, execute the following command:

php artisan test

Alternatively, you can use:

./vendor/bin/phpunit

This will run the test cases and show the results in the terminal.
9. Serve the Application

Start the Laravel development server:

php artisan serve

The application will be accessible at http://localhost:8000/login
